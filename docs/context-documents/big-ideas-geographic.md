# **Big Ideas: Spatiotemporal Cryptocurrency Interest**

1. **Attention Is the New Currency**  
   Global search interest reveals that *curiosity moves faster than capital.* Before prices react, people search.  
   Peaks in Google Trends often precede market hype, showing that **public attention is the first ripple before financial waves.**  
   In a digital economy, information—not money—is the earliest mover.

2. **Interest Is Uneven, Not Universal**  
   Cryptocurrencies are global, but fascination with them isn’t.  
   Our regional visualizations show **Asia (Japan, South Korea, China)** as consistent leaders in search interest, while **Western regions** follow cyclical patterns tied to media and market events.  
   The crypto revolution may be decentralized—but its *adoption story is deeply regional.*

3. **2021 Was the Year of Collective Euphoria**  
   Time-series data show a synchronized global surge in early 2021, where nearly every country experienced record search volumes.  
   This period marks a **worldwide psychological event**, blending speculative hope, social media momentum, and mainstream curiosity.  
   The charts make it visible: *for a moment, crypto was everyone’s story.*

4. **Dogecoin: The Power and Fragility of Virality**  
   In May 2021, Dogecoin’s search interest spiked dramatically—only to collapse within months.  
   Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose interest stabilizes over time, Dogecoin’s graph captures the **volatile half-life of internet culture.**  
   The lesson: hype burns bright, but insight endures.

5. **Decline Doesn’t Mean Disappearance**  
   After the global peaks of 2021, average search volumes fell throughout 2022.  
   Yet the base level of attention never returned to pre-boom lows—indicating a **structural shift in public awareness.**  
   Even in quieter times, crypto remains a permanent part of global conversation.

**Ultimate Takeaway:**  
Don’t ask *“What’s the next big coin?”*  
Ask *“Where—and when—does the world start paying attention?”*  
The time-series and regional visualizations reveal that **attention is cyclical, regional, and predictive.**  
Understanding it isn’t just observing hype—**it’s reading the emotional map of the digital economy.**
