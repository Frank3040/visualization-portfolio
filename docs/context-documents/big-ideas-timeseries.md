# Big Ideas: Time Series Visualizations

## 1. **Price is Noise, But Risk Has Memory**  
Cryptocurrency prices follow a random walk—past values offer no edge in predicting the future. Yet volatility is not random: high-risk periods cluster in time. This duality means **you can’t beat the market, but you can avoid its worst moments**.

## 2. **The Illusion of Patterns**  
Human brains see trends in randomness. The ACF of returns—flat and insignificant—proves that most “chart patterns” are cognitive illusions. True signal isn’t in price direction; it’s in the **structure of uncertainty**.

## 3. **Volatility Is the Only Forecastable Variable**  
While returns are white noise, squared returns tell a different story: today’s volatility predicts tomorrow’s. This is the foundation of GARCH models and the single most reliable insight for risk-aware crypto investors.

## 4. **Stationarity Is the Gateway to Analysis**  
Raw prices are non-stationary (ACF decays slowly). But returns are stationary (ACF dies immediately). This transformation isn’t just statistical hygiene—it’s the **key that unlocks valid inference**. Without it, all analysis is meaningless.

> 🎯 **Ultimate Takeaway**:  
> *Don’t ask “Where is the price going?”  
> Ask “How dangerous is it to be exposed right now?”*  
> The time series visualizations answer the second question—with clarity, rigor, and humility.
